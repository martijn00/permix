# Permix — Agent skill specification

Library: **permix** @ 4.1.2  
Repository: https://github.com/letstri/permix  
Docs: https://permix.letstri.dev/docs

## Purpose

These skills teach coding agents how to integrate Permix v4 in consumer applications: schema design, `setup`, `check`, UI adapters, server middleware, SSR hydration, HTTP PDP, and provider identity adapters. They are derived from `docs/content/docs/` and `permix/src/` — not from model training cutoffs.

## Skill inventory

| Slug | Type | Domain | Load when |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| `permix-getting-started` | core | core-setup | New Permix install, schema, roles, templates |
| `permix` | core | authorization + frontend + server | Everything past initial setup: `check`/ReBAC, UI + SSR, server middleware, HTTP PDP, Supabase, Better Auth, Clerk, and Convex |

`permix` is a single skill with a thin `SKILL.md` router and five reference
files loaded on demand: `references/check.md`, `references/frontend.md`,
`references/server.md`, `references/extraction.md`, and
`references/providers.md`.

## Critical failure modes

See `_artifacts/domain_map.yaml` → `failure_modes`. Highest priority:

1. **v3 schema shape in v4 projects** — use action tuples, not `{ action, dataType }`.
2. **hydrate without client `setup`** — dynamic rules are lost in JSON; always `setup` after hydrate.
3. **Client-only checks** — mirror paths on server with `setupMiddleware` + `checkMiddleware`.
4. **Treating app checks as database enforcement** — Supabase browser access
   still requires RLS; JWT claims may remain stale until refresh.

## Source-of-truth policy

When `docs/content/docs/` or public API in `permix/src/` changes:

1. Update the affected `permix/skills/*/SKILL.md` and bump `library_version` on release.
2. Run `pnpm run skills:stale` from `permix/` (or monorepo CI `intent stale`).
3. Align `sources` in SKILL frontmatter with the changed doc paths.

## Out of scope (docs-only for now)

- `permix/effect`, `permix/drizzle`, `permix/standard-schema` — documented at https://permix.letstri.dev/docs/integrations/effect, `/drizzle`, and `/standard-schema`; no dedicated skill yet.

## Registry

Package keyword `tanstack-intent` enables discovery on the [Agent Skills Registry](https://tanstack.com/intent/registry). Each npm release re-indexes skills and version history automatically.
